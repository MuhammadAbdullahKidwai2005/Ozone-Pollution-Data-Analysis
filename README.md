# 🌫️ Ozone Pollution Data Analysis

This project analyzes ozone concentration levels across California using real-world EPA data from January 2024. It focuses on cleaning, exploring, and visualizing trends in air quality to uncover high-risk regions and evaluate the impact of human activity.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw EPA air quality data
- Analyze daily ozone trends
- Identify high-risk regions
- Compare weekday vs. weekend pollution
- Visualize geospatial ozone hotspots

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python (Google Colab)
- pandas – data cleaning & analysis
- matplotlib – trend plotting
- plotly – geospatial heatmaps

## 📈 Key Insights

- Ozone levels were stable over the month
- Slightly higher pollution on weekdays than weekends
- Data showed limited geographic diversity (mostly one site)

## 📂 Data Columns (Sample)

- `Date`  
- `Daily Max 8-hour Ozone Concentration`  
- `Daily AQI Value`  
- `County`, `CBSA Name`, `Method Code`  
- `Site Latitude`, `Site Longitude`  
- `Day Type` (Weekday/Weekend)

## 📍 Visualization Preview

> Interactive geospatial heatmaps were created using Plotly to highlight high ozone zones across California.
